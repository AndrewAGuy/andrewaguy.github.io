# Microfluidics
I came into this topic via vascularization, but I am also interested in it in its own right.

## Contributions
- If you're already doing cell culture, you can get started with microfluidics for the cost of a laser cutter, some acrylic sheet and PDMS.
[Here is a simple, freely-licensed device to get started with.](/files/mfcd-v1.1.zip) It's matched to standard microscopy slides and at common depth/material combinations can be operated by capillary action alone.

## Collaborations
I am currently working with students at the *Centre for Computational Medicine, University College London* to test the low-cost device.

# Consulting

I am available to hire as a consultant for engineering projects, with particular expertise in:
- **Biomimetic and cost-optimized pipe networks**
  - [Tissue engineering](/consulting/bioengineering): ensuring cell survival, influencing behavior and functionality.
  - [Two-scale flow problems](/consulting/industrial): scaling up reactions in porous media, distributing reagents within a volume.
- **Hardware/software design**
  - Electronic control and sensing systems.
  - Image and signal processing.
  - Automated component design and CAD interoperation from rapid prototyping to mass production.

I offer discounted rates for academic projects with the option to relicense at a later date if you decide to commercialize --- and if your problem is so hard that a novel approach is required to solve it, I'll write the corresponding methods section for publication at no extra charge.

# Teaching
A record of everything I have taught, and teaching materials that I have written over the years.
Please send me corrections and suggestions, or if you want to extend them I'm happy to provide the LaTeX sources.

### Engineering, University of Cambridge
##### Courses

I was a supervisor at the college level (2<sup>nd</sup> year courses, Peterhouse) as well as the departmental level (3<sup>rd</sup> year courses) during my PhD and shortly after.
Supervisions are like seminars but with 2--3 students per session:
for engineering, a typical supervision involves trying to find gaps in their understanding and making sure that they can do all questions on a problem sheet, then pushing them beyond their comfort zone in the remaining time.

- 2P7 _"Mathematical Methods"_: a course on PDEs, probability and linear algebra.
  - [Notes on curl, divergence and shear: decomposing the gradient](/files/curl-div.pdf)
  - [Notes on angular velocity](/files/angular-velocity.pdf)
- 3M1 _"Mathematical Methods"_: linear algebra, optimization, markov processes and sampling.
  - [Notes on a positive-definiteness trick that's no longer taught](/files/sylvesters-criterion.pdf)
- 3F2 _"Systems and Control"_: intro to dynamical systems, Lyapunov's indirect method, block diagrams and design for common types of controllers.
  - [Companion guide](/files/3f2-notes.pdf): for the 2023 year when I had 20 groups of students, I wrote this in an attempt to fill in any missing information, answer common questions and provide an alternative view to the course.

##### Projects

- Master's project _"Characterisation of 3D Vascular Networks"_ (2019--20, co-supervised with Prof. Athina Markaki)

### Private tutoring

I have previously tutored students aged 12--18 in mathematics, both extracurricular and remedial.
I am not currently taking new students.

# Teaching
A record of everything I have taught.

### Engineering, University of Cambridge
##### Courses

I was a supervisor at the college level (2<sup>nd</sup> year courses, Peterhouse) as well as the departmental level (3<sup>rd</sup> year courses) during my PhD.
(Supervisions are like seminars but with 2--3 students per session, [read more here](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/how-will-i-be-taught).)

- 2P7 _"Mathematical Methods"_
- 3M1 _"Mathematical Methods"_
- 3F2 _"Systems and Control"_

##### Projects

- John Paul Wu, _"Characterisation of 3D Vascular Networks"_ (MEng, 2019--20, co-supervised with Prof. Athina Markaki)

### Private tutoring

I have previously tutored students aged 12--18 in mathematics, both extracurricular and remedial.
I am not currently taking new students.
